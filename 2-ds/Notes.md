# Basic Data Structures

`push` adds to the front of an array
`pop` removes the first element
`unshift` adds to the end
`shift` removes the last element

`splice` can be used to remove elements from an array and add elements to an array. you can specify the index and amount to delete.

`slice` copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched

 indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.
